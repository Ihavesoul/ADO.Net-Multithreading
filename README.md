## C# examples
This is a repository which is dedicated to the usual programs in C #, which I implemented within the framework of the university or any courses.

1. ADO.Net  - A simple library that works with a specific database. The project follows the rules SOLID.
2. File downloader ( Windows Form application) - Perhaps in the future will be redone under WPF.
3. Philosopher Dining Problem - standard threading task
